#### Application Description:

Fashions and styles go in and out of vogue so often it leaves you helpless against the constant and increasing flow of information. Search engines are only good to help you hone in on what you already know and want to learn more about. 

The traditional approach has been to use machine learning algorithms based on your likes and dislikes. Unfortunately, this helps you refine your current tastes. It does not help you learn about new ones. A defining feature of fashion is "new-ness." Machine learning algorithms just can't help you get at this unique human experience. 

Worse still, big corporations use tactics, like Search Engine Optimization (SEO), to reinforce specific fashions and styles to ensure consumer cycles as part of their revenue strategy. The fashions and styles you get may be contrived, leaving you in a constant identity crisis. What does the real you look like in a world where you are being manipulated constantly?

Enter Catlick. Catlick provides a simple visual interface to get fashion and style information. Each time you click on our Catlick button, you will visit a random page that is part of a pre-selected listing of fashion blogs and style websites. Trying new things is an excellent way to get information that surprises your taste buds. In this day and age, with the massive manipulative apparatus at work, trying new things is hard. Catlick uses randomness to get back to re-balancing the scales so you can be the real you - without all the noise.
